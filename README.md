# Project Description

All State, a personal insurance company in the United States, is interested in leveraging data science to predict the severity and the cost of insurance claims post an unforeseen event.
We will predict how severe insurance claims will be for All State. We accomplish this using ensemble machine learning algorithms.

# Project Highlights

    Exploratory data analysis to understand the Allstate insurance claim dataset

    Analyzing 5 point summary and studying data distribution for categorical variables

    Handling missing values for categorical and continuous variables

    Outlier treatment with visual techniques (Box-Plots)
    
    Use of Pickle file format to store and load models

    Feature selection and elimination using Correlation, Constant Variance and Chi-Square statistical tests

    Use of ensemble Machine Learning algorithms

    Hyper-parameter tuning using Sklearn functions

    Model deployment creating FlaskAPI
