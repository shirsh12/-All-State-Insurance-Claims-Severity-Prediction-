# Project Description

All State, a personal insurance company in the United States, is interested in leveraging data science to predict the severity and the cost of insurance claims post an unforeseen event.
We will predict how severe insurance claims will be for All State. We accomplish this using ensemble machine learning algorithms.

# Project Highlights

   1.Exploratory data analysis to understand the Allstate insurance claim dataset

   2.Analyzing 5 point summary and studying data distribution for categorical variables

   3.Handling missing values for categorical and continuous variables

   4.Outlier treatment with visual techniques (Box-Plots)
    
   5.Use of Pickle file format to store and load models

   6.Feature selection and elimination using Correlation, Constant Variance and Chi-Square statistical tests

   7.Use of ensemble Machine Learning algorithms

   8.Hyper-parameter tuning using Sklearn functions

   9.Model deployment creating FlaskAPI
